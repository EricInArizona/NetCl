/*
To Do:

It can be a straight pass through server.
Like to see the packets in TLS.

If I can specifiy the remote server in XLib then I
can pass it through and read the messages.

Could I put a TLS translater and pass through to
the old map image server?

For sockets.
man poll
 the poll() system call),

The simplest, basic message server.
Sends a message to another client or a list of clients
or all clients.

I could make a local Unix Domain Socket server without
 encryption and then
once I work it out I can make an internet server with
AES encryption.

stdlib.h

 Execute the given line as a shell command.

extern int system (const char *__command) __wur;

What is it execlv() or what?

unistd.h

   Return -1 for errors, 0 to the new process,
   and the process ID of the new process to the old process.
extern __pid_t fork (void) __THROWNL;
